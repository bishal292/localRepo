to add a cuurent repository to git : "git init" command is used

To add/connect a current or any local repository with github 
    1. first create a repository on github without md file the copy the link of the repository then,  below command is used in termial
        git remote add origin <link_of_the_repository>
            origin can be anyName which is would be used to define the remote repository with the same name
            but origin is mainly preferred

To check or verify remote repository below command is used 
    git remote -v
to upload all the commit files on github push command is used.
    git push repository_Name branch_name

if we are working for a long time in a same repository and required to push repetedly then 
    git push -u origin(repository_Name) main(branch_name)

    after this we can only use git push to push all the other files in the repository
Basically branch means multiple change in a single code at a time without affect other
    Branches allow multiple developers to work on different aspects of a project 
    simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. Each branch represents 
    an independent set of changes to the codebase.
to check current branch below command is used 
    git branch
to rename current branch name below command is used 
    git branch -M New_Name
to create a new branch
    git checkout-b <new_Branch_Name> 
to navigate or change branch
    git checkout <branch_name>
to delete a branch
    git branch -d <branch_name>
to push a content on required branch
    git push origin <branch_name>

To Add multiple folders(Sub-folders) in a git repository Simply we can add by using same command used for uploading files.

BUt for deleting a sub folder the command is :-
        git rm -r <Sub_Folder_Name OR Directory>


To compare or find difference between two branch is:
    git diff <Another_branch_name>

To merge two Branches
    git merge <branch_name>

To fetch and download content from remote repository(It is done when changes in a content is directly made through git hub.)
    it download the remote repository and replace with our local repository

        git pull <remote_repository_Name> <branch_name>
        |
        
        --->>> It is also used when merging our forked code changes to the origninal ownler


Conflict while merging contents occur
    when same line in the content is different in the Branches

To check all the commits log:
    git log
UNDOING CHANGES
condition: 
    1. If a file is added(Staged) but not commited and want to jump(undo) on previous commit then
        git reset <file_Name>
    2. commited changes(For one commit)
        git reset HEAD~1        (LAtest chang (commit) is named as HEAD. This will reset the changes with the last commit in the git)
    3. commited change(For many code)
        git reset <commit_Hash>                 (used to discard the changes done in the given commit(commit_Hash))
        OR
        git reset --hard <commit_Hash>          (--hard is used to remove all the changes done after the commit included (commit_Hash))

Fork 
    It is a rough copy of previous repository which incledes all the same code and visibility setting from the previous one.
